## Building This Website

I earned my degree in Computer Science a few years ago, and ever since my first class in web development, I wanted a personal website. I had the knowledge of creating a basic HTML page, could make it (relatively) pretty with CSS, and could even do some minor interactivity with JavaScript. But the one concept they don't teach you in school is hosting.

Sure, the school runs a webserver for student work, but all pages are under some obscure URL and would be emphemeral. I finish school, then what? I don't have access to that server anymore. And they have no reason to keep my work availble on the server. Obviously I need it hosted elsewhere. This was a bit of a roadblock for two reasons: I didn't know how to run a server and two, I didn't really feel like paying for anything. Just out of school, I didn't care for that kind of thing yet.

Life gets in the way. I got a job out of school (doing web development incidentally), got married, and moved on with life. In my job I actually learned a few things about running a server. 

### Domains

 * How many domains do I have now?
### Hosting
 * To self-host or outsource?
### Netlify and GH Pages
 * Continuous deployment and Netlify's free tier
### Creating this Website in details
 * Eleventy and such
